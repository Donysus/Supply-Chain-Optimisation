# Supply-Chain-Optimization
This project implements a supply chain optimization model using the [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) library in Python. The objective is to minimize transportation costs while distributing supply from warehouses to retailers under supply and demand constraints.

## Features

- **Optimization Model:** Formulated as a linear programming problem.
- **Cost Minimization:** Minimizes total transportation cost based on predefined cost parameters.
- **Constraints:** Includes supply constraints for warehouses and demand constraints for retailers.
- **Results:** Outputs the optimal transportation plan and total cost.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SupplyChainOptimization.git
   cd SupplyChainOptimization
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
Run the optimization script:
```bash
python supply_chain_optimization.py
```

This will:
Solve the supply chain optimization problem.
Print the optimal transportation plan.
Display the total transportation cost.

## Files
Supply_Chain_Optimization.py - Main script implementing the optimization model.
requirements.txt - List of required Python packages.
.gitignore - Specifies files/folders to be ignored by Git.
